## Known Issues

* Lane Direction Tool

   * Does not support merge lanes

   * Does not support roundabouts

   * When an entire direction is banned, some traffic may still proceed through the banned direction

* Pedestrian traffic lights may not operate as expected when the "Always Green Left/Right-Turns" option is active

   * This option can prevent some pedestrian signals from turning green, so an exclusive pedestrian phase has been added to every cycle
