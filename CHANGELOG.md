## Changes

* Fixed an issue preventing users from setting lane directions at junctions with parallel roads (Credit: beVistum, Bruceyboy24804)

* Updated to be compatible with version 1.0.15f1

## Known Issues

* Lane Direction Tool

   * Does not support merge lanes

   * Does not support roundabouts

   * When an entire direction is banned, some traffic may still proceed through the banned direction

* Pedestrian traffic lights may not operate as expected when the "Always Green Left/Right-Turns" option is active

   * This option can prevent some pedestrian signals from turning green, so an exclusive pedestrian phase has been added to every cycle
