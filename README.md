## Traffic Lights Enhancement Alpha

* Set traffic lights to various predefined signal modes
* Guide available [here](https://github.com/slyh/Cities2-TrafficLightsEnhancement/tree/main/GUIDE.md)
* Compatible with version 1.0.15f1

The mod will save extra data to your saves, which it relies on to provide additional functionality. Generally, traffic lights and junctions will revert to vanilla settings when the mod is removed, but this cannot be guaranteed.

You cannot downgrade the mod to an older version. Cities saved with the new version are not compatible with previous versions.

**Warning: These modifications are highly experimental. Your game may crash more frequently, and your save files could be corrupted.**
